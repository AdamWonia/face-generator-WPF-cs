# Face Generator WPF C#

This repository contains a Face Generator project made in C# using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The program provides a window containing a face made using different shapes, and the user can independently change the colours of each shape. There is also an option to generate random colours for each shape. The user can save the made face to an image file (.png or .jpg) in a directory of their choice. 

## Launch

To run the program, you can open the project using the Visual Studio IDE and just click the Run button or go to the *FaceGenerator\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1* folder, where there is a **FaceGenerator.exe** file that you can run directly.

## Closing words

The project can be further developed, for example by adding the option to change the shape of the face, nose, mouth, hat or eyes. You can also try creating your own face gallery, where you can show all the faces you have created.
